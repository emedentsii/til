How to serve Markdown
=====================

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing


To write inline code block, wrap it in backticks.
To show text as block code wrap it in triple backticks.

Also same work for code syntax highlighting, jus put  language name after firs triple backtick

```python
if is_awesome:
  return True

```
Next example show how to use headers:

```
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
```
Next example show how to use quotes.
> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway
Sub-heading


Paragraphs are separated
by a blank line.


Text attributes _italic_,
**bold**, `monospace`, *Emphasize*.



Bullet list:

  * apples
  * oranges
  * pears

Numbered list:

  1. apples
  2. oranges
  3. pears


  Alternatively,

  - Dashes work just as well
  - And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
    - Like this
    - And this

    List with completed and uncomleted items:

    - [x] This is a complete item
    - [ ] This is an incomplete item

  If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

Tables can be used in markdown also:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

To display table above next syntax needed:
```
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
```
~~Text wil aapear crossed out if you use~~ `~~syntax~~`
